# Anonymous Classes

You know the anonymous functions..right!
```php
$bla = function ($value='')
{
    # code...
}
```
Welcome to the anonymous classes :D
```php
$bla = new class
{
    public function bla()
    {
        # code...
    }
}
# now you can use it like
$bla->bla();
```
like anonymous function, anonymous class use for fast small operations or testing.
