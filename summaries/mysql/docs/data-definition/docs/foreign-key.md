A `foreign key` can be a column or a set of columns. The columns in the child table often refer to the `primary key` columns in the parent table.

A table may have more than one `foreign key`, and each `foreign key` in the child table may refer to a different parent tables.

Sometimes, the child and parent tables are the same. The `foreign key` refers back to the `primary key` of the table. Please check [self join](../data-manipulation/join.md#self-join).

`Foreign keys` enforce referential integrity that helps you maintain the consistency and integrity of the data automatically. For example, you cannot create an order for a non-existent customer.

In addition, you can set up a `cascade on delete` action for the `foreign key` column so that when you delete a parent column in the parent table, all the child column associated with the parent column are also deleted. This saves you time and efforts of using multiple `DELETE` statements or a `DELETE JOIN` statement.

The same as deletion, you can also define a `cascade on update` action for the `foreign key` column to perform the cross-table update without using multiple` UPDATE` statements or an `UPDATE JOIN` statement.

#### `ON [DELETE/UPDATE]` options:

Option | Description
---|---|
`NO ACTION` | `InnoDB` rejects the delete or update operation for the parent table.
`RESTRICT` | `RESTRICT` is synonymous to `NO ACTION` and those are default behavior.
`SET NULL` | Delete or update the row from the parent table and set the foreign key column or columns in the child table to `NULL`.
`CASCADE` | Delete or update the row from the parent table and automatically delete or update the matching rows in the child table.
`SET DEFAULT` | This action is recognized by the parser, but `InnoDB` rejects table definitions containing `ON [DELETE/UPDATE] SET DEFAULT` clauses.

### Create Foreign Keys
You can define the `FOREIGN KEYS` with column as a following syntax illustrates:
```sql
CONSTRAINT constraint_name
FOREIGN KEY foreign_key_name (columns)
REFERENCES parent_table(columns)
ON DELETE action
ON UPDATE action
```
Example:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS dbdemo;

USE dbdemo;

CREATE TABLE categories(
   cat_id int not null auto_increment primary key,
   cat_name varchar(255) not null,
   cat_description text
) ENGINE=InnoDB;

CREATE TABLE products(
   prd_id int not null auto_increment primary key,
   prd_name varchar(355) not null,
   prd_price decimal,
   cat_id int not null,
   FOREIGN KEY fk_cat(cat_id)
   REFERENCES categories(cat_id)
   ON UPDATE CASCADE
   ON DELETE RESTRICT
)ENGINE=InnoDB;
```

### Adding a Foreign Key To a Table
You can `ALTER` the `FOREIGN KEYS` with column as a following syntax illustrates:
```sql
ALTER table_name
ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name
FOREIGN KEY foreign_key_name(columns)
REFERENCES parent_table(columns)
ON DELETE action
ON UPDATE action;
```
Example:
```sql
ALTER TABLE products
ADD FOREIGN KEY fk_vendor(vdr_id)
REFERENCES vendors(vdr_id)
ON DELETE NO ACTION
ON UPDATE CASCADE;
```

### Dropping Foreign Key
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP FOREIGN KEY constraint_name;
```

### Disabling Foreign Key Checks
To see the `foreign keys` of a table
```sql
SHOW CREATE TABLE table_name;
```

Sometimes, it is very useful to disable foreign key checks e.g., when you import data from a CSV file into a table. If you donâ€™t disable foreign key checks, you have to load data into a proper order i.e., you have to load data into parent tables first and then child tables, which can be tedious

So to Disabling `foreign key` checks
```sql
SET foreign_key_checks = 0;

# To re-enable it
SET foreign_key_checks = 1;
```
