### Table Elements

* **The Table Name:** which is located at the top of the table.
* **The Primary Keys:** Remember the primary keys uniquely identify each row in a table.  A table typically has one primary key, but can have more. When the key has more than one column, it is called a **compound key**.
* **Table Columns:** There can be one or more table columns.  To keep the diagrams simple, I donâ€™t show the data types.  I may introduce those later when we focus on more comprehensive modeling.
* **Foreign Key:** This is a column or set of columns which match a primary key in another table.
